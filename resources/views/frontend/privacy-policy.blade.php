                <p>
                Impact Global Consultant (IGC) uses standard website security practices to protect your personal information, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transmission technology for all sensitive information exchanges.

                    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and after receiving it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.
